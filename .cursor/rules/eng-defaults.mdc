Start every answer with "HELLO LORD WONG"

Use clear consise style.

Include doc strings for every folder, file, class, and function.

Don't use "magic numbers" or hardcoded strings throughout the code. Organize them logically so they are in one place and and can be easily maintained.

Write tests for all new functions/classes and anything edited by cursor.

Use conda for python package management.

Before making edits, consider if the edits should be on a clean git branch, and if that would be best practice ask to start a new branch and commit work there. Similarly, after a bunch of changes have been made, think about if this should be done on a new branch and what we should be committing in useful chunks.
